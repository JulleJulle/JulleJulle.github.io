   <h1>Playstation</h1>
   <div class="kiva">
<p>The first<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)">Playstation console</a> was released in Japan in December 1994, 
    and worldwide the following year.[1] The original console in the series
     was the first console of any type to ship over 100 million units, doing so in under 
     a decade.[2] Its successor, the <strong>Playstation 2</strong> , was released in 2000; it is the best-selling
      home console to date, having reached over 155 million units sold by the end of 2012.[3] Sony
      's next console, the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006, selling over 87.4 million units b
       March 2017.[4] Sony's next console, the <strong>Playstation 4</strong> , was released in 2013, selling a
        million units within a day, becoming the fastest selling console in history.[5] The
         latest console in the series, the <strong>Playstation 5</strong> , was released in 2020[6]
          and sold 10 million units in its first 249 days, unseating its predecessor
           as the fastest-selling PlayStation console to-date.[7] The main series of
            controllers utilized by the PlayStation series is the DualShock, a line of
             vibration-feedback gamepads that sold 28 million units by June 2008.[8]</p>

   <h2>History</h2>
   <p>Until 1991, Sony had little direct involvement with the video game industry. The
     company supplied components for other consoles, such as the sound chip for the Super
      Famicom from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> , and operated a video game studio, Sony Imagesoft.[20] As part of
       a joint project between Nintendo and Sony that began as early as 1988, the two companies
        worked to create a CD-ROM version of the Super Famicom,[21] though Nintendo denied the 
        existence of the Sony deal as late as March 1991.[22] At the Consumer Electronics Show
         in June 1991, Sony revealed a Super Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive that incorporated
          Green Book technology or CD-i, called "Play Station" (also known as SNES-CD). However,
           a day after the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its
            partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology
            .[23] The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement 
            on how revenue would be split between the two companies.[23] The breaking of the
             partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing
              Kutaragi with the responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival 
              Nintendo.[23]</p>

   <h3>Playstation</h3>
   <div class="jep">
   <p>The original PlayStation, released in Japan on December 3, 1994, was the first of the ubiquitous
     PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices. It has included successor consoles and upgrades
      including the Net Yaroze (a special black PlayStation with tools and instructions to program PlayStation
       games and applications), "PS one" (a smaller version of the original) and the PocketStation (a handheld
        which enhances PlayStation games and also acts as a memory card). It was part of the fifth generation of video
         game consoles competing against the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. By December 2003, the PlayStation and PS one
          had shipped a combined total of 102.49 million units,[29] eventually becoming the first video game console to sell
          120 million units.[2]</p>

          <h3>Playstation 5</h3>
          <p>The PlayStation 5 (PS5)[51] was released worldwide on November 12, 2020, and, alongside the Xbox Series X and 
            Series S released the same month, is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">ninth generation of video game consoles</a> . The first news of the PS5
             came from Mark Cerny in an interview with Wired in April 2019.[52] Sony intends for the PlayStation 5 to be its
              next-generation console and to ship worldwide by the end of 2020.[53] In early 2019, Sony's financial report for 
              the quarter ending March 31, 2019, affirmed that new next-generation hardware was in development but would ship no earlier than April 2020.[54]</p>
